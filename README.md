it's in c. it's in raylib. it's in sip. it's in rest. it's probably in some more stuff...

## prerequisites

### clang
* must support `c23` (as we are targeting this release)

### packages @ debian-based systems:

```shell
sudo apt -y install libx11-dev libglfw3-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev
# this is for raylib
```

i have only tested with debian, and ubuntu. i fully expect make to break on other systems (for now)
